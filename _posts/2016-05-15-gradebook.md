        <p>GradeBook is an android application I programmed in Android Studio to keep a record of a student's assignments and grades as well as calculating their term and class averages. This project records the information you enter into the text boxes as a string with identifiers within it. The storage/retrieval of the user's data is done through the use of modularization. The repository for this project is located <a href="https://github.com/ryannewman2828/GradeBook" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
