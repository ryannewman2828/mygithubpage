        <p>Exodius Arena is a web application that allows people to register accounts, login, add friends, send messages, make progress to unlocking characters and using those characters in a single player arena style game. This application makes use of the MEAN stack for its web technology needs. Bootstrap and JQuery are used to handle the animations/dynamic scalabilities of the project. Gulp is used as the file runner for compiling, concatinating and minifying files together. SASS is used as the CSS framework for improved styling. Jasmine is used to unit test the functionality of the server while Protractor is used for the e2e testing of the site. The repository for this project is located <a href="https://github.com/ryannewman2828/Exodius-Arena" target="_blank">here</a>. This project is a work in progress as the actual game element has not yet been implemented, but is planned to be with the use of websockets to support real time communication between the client and the server.</p>
