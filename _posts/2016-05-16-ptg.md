        <p>The Procedural Terrain Generator is a program that generates randomized two dimensional terrain. It accomplishes this by using a fractal algorithm to break apart a line segment into two to the power of n - 1, where n is the amount of performed iterations. The repository for this project is located <a href="https://github.com/ryannewman2828/Procedural-Terrain-Generator" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
