                <p>I am a student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science with an option in Software Engineering. I am a hard working, self-motivated individual who will work diligently on projects until completion. I have always been interested in creating and developing as well as learning new languages and techniques to accomplish this. I have worked with numerous languages ranging from HTML to Java and worked with many developer tools such as libGDX and Android Studio. The scope of my projects range from web design to game development to algorithm implementation to app development. I am always seeking to improve my software skills and apply my knowledge to solve problems and improve the quality of life.</p>
