                <p>I am a student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science with an option in Software Engineering. I am a hard working, self-motivated individual who enjoys a challenge and works hard to achieve his goals. I have always been interested in creating and developing software to either solve problems that exist in the world around us or to enrich my knowledge of core computing concepts. I also use these projects as an oppurtunity to try out a range of new and diverse technologies and programming languages. I have worked with numerous programming languages ranging from HTML to Java to Golang and worked with many development frameworks such as Spring and AngularJS. The scope of my projects range from web applications to algorithm implementations to scripting to proof of concept prototypes. I am always seeking to improve the depth and breadth of my software skills and apply the knowledge I have aquired to deliver effective solutions to the problems that we face on a day to day basis.</p>
