    desc: "I personally designed this website from scratch. This website uses Jekyll to abstract out content and to combine configuration files written in YAML, template files written in Markdown and data files written in JSON into one coherent website. The Markdown files consist of HTML5 code and the styling is done in Sass which gets compiled down to CSS. Using the Bootstrap framework I was able to add dynamic scalability to the website meaning the website will automatically adapt to different sized browsers and devices. JavaScript along with jQuery were used to allow the skills in the skills tab to be loaded/unloaded on button pushes. A Golang script was also packaged with the site to allow for new entries, i.e. projects and skills, to be created with ease."
