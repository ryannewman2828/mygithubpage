    desc: "Plâˆ€n is a web application that allows people to register accounts, login, add friends, send messages and plan meetings with friends. This application makes use of the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js) stack. Bootstrap and JQuery are used for easy styling and animations. Gulp is used as the file runner for compiling, concatinating and minifying files. SASS is used as the CSS framework for improved/abstracted styling. Mocha is used to unit test the functionality of the server while Protractor is used for the e2e testing of the site. Some cool features of this project include the application following The Twelve-Factor app methodology allowing it to be fully cloud native and using websockets for a realtime messaging/friend feature. This project is still a WIP with many features still to be added. These changes include implementing a more responsive/animated front end, deploying on a cloud based platform and implementing redis for session caching. The repository for this project is located <a href=\"https://github.com/ryannewman2828/Exodius-Arena\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>."
