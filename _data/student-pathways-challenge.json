    desc: "The Student Pathways challenge was meant to help high school students gain a better understanding of available career opportunities and the pathways to get there by means of a digital tool. This was a 6 week competition where our team, The Communitechies, built a web application to help students find the perfect post-secondary educational institution and job to fit their personality. Our team placed 2<sup>nd</sup> overall from around 50 teams winning a cash prize of $13,000. I worked as the tech lead on this project meaning that in phase 1 of the competition I led the technical direction for the project in terms of algorithm designs, creation of the stories and programming of the entire backend. The backend consited of a RESTful api that managed the favouriting/generation of pathways and the algorithm was a simple configuration based approach to serve predetermined pathways. For phase 2, I developed a sustainable and scalable strategy for our app which included a dynamic pathway generation algorithm and recommender system to suggest personalized pathways. I presented our project with 2 others at the MaRS Discovery District infront of a panel of esteemed judges including the Chief Digital Officer of Ontario.</p>
