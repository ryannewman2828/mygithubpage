    desc: "The main purpose of the UW Events App was to inform students about events that are often ignored. To accomplish this, we built a centralized hub where event information is located. Students can find information about event locations and receive email reminders to attend. All event information, employer sessions, workshops, entertainment and more, is available on the site. The site pulled information about these events from RSS' feeds from multiple sites then used php to dynamically display them on the page. We registered users and stored their information in a database and used mySQL to retrieve it then we sent reminder emails to the users using a python framework. The information was stored in an Amazon web services server. For the front-end of the site HMTL 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript was used to style the webpage, add animations/effects and dynamic scalability. Github was used as the version control and to allow everyone to contribute to the project. My personal responsibility for this project was being in charge of the front end. I found a starter template and did all of the styling, animating and scaling for the web application. The website can be found at "
