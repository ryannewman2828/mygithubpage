    desc: "The Procedural Terrain Generator is a program that generates randomized two dimensional terrain. It accomplishes this by using a fractal algorithm to break apart a line segment into two to the power of n - 1, where n is the amount of performed iterations. The repository for this project is located <a href=\"https://github.com/ryannewman2828/Procedural-Terrain-Generator\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>."
