        <p>Cave Fighter is a Java based game programmed utilizing the JPanel and the JFrame. The game is based on Edmund McMillen’s and Florian Himsl’s, "The Binding of Isaac". The game uses a chunking algorithm to procedurally generate room layouts and fills them with random enemies in one of many predetermined patterns. This project was programmed as an educational excercise to demonstrate usage and understanding of object oriented programming principles such as abstraction for enemies, polymorphism for defining the specific behaviour for each of the subclasses and encapsulation for hiding information thus allowing usage of these classes only through a defined interface. The objective of the game is to fight through rooms until you reach the boss room. When the boss is defeated the game resets. This project has recently been refactored to include design patterns and make usage of popular Computer Science idioms such as the PIMPL idiom. The design patterns that were used include the singleton pattern for the main character and factory pattern for declaring the enemies. The repository for the game is located <a href="https://github.com/ryannewman2828/Cave-Fighter" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Pl∀n is a web application that allows people to register accounts, login, add friends, send messages and plan meetings with friends. This application makes use of the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js) stack. Bootstrap and JQuery are used to for easy styling and animations. Gulp is used as the file runner for compiling, concatinating and minifying files. SASS is used as the CSS framework for improved/abstracted styling. Mocha is used to unit test the functionality of the server while Protractor is used for the e2e testing of the site. Some cool features of this project include it following the 12 factor app methodology allowing it to be fully cloud native and using websockets for a realtime messaging/friend feature. This project is still a WIP with many features still to be added. These changes include implementing a more responsive/animated front end, deploying on a cloud based platform and implementing redis for session caching.

    <p>The main purpose of the UW Events App was to inform students about events that are often ignored. To accomplish this, we built a centralized hub where event information is located. Students can find information about event locations and receive email reminders to attend. All event information, employer sessions, workshops, entertainment and more, is available on the site. The site pulled information about these events from RSS' feeds from multiple sites then used php to dynamically display them on the page. We registered users and stored their information in a database and used mySQL to retrieve it then we sent reminder emails to the users using a python framework. The information was stored in an Amazon web services server. For the front-end of the site HMTL 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript was used to style the webpage, add animations/effects and dynamic scalability. Github was used as the version control and to allow everyone to contribute to the project. My personal responsibility for this project was being in charge of the front end. I found a starter template and did all of the styling, animating and scaling for the web application.

    <p>I personally designed this website from scratch. This website uses Jekyll to abstract out content and to combine configuration files written in YAML, template files written in Markdown and data files written in JSON into one coherent website. The Markdown files consist of HTML5 code and the styling is done in Sass which gets compiled down to CSS. Using the Bootstrap framework I was able add dynamic scalability to the website meaning the website will automatically adapt to different sized browsers and devices. JavaScript along with jQuery were used to allow the skills in the skills tab to be loaded/unloaded on button pushes. A Golang script was also packaged with the site to allow for new entries, i.e. projects and skills, to be created with ease.</p>

    <p>The Procedural Terrain Generator is a program that generates randomized two dimensional terrain. It accomplishes this by using a fractal algorithm to break apart a line segment into two to the power of n - 1, where n is the amount of performed iterations.

    <p>GradeBook is an android application I programmed in Android Studio to keep a record of a student's assignments and grades as well as calculating their term and class averages. This project records the information you enter into the text boxes as a string with identifiers within it. The storage/retrieval of the user's data is done through the use of modularization.
