    <p>Documented-Learning is my repository meant for housing prototype works and documenting the learning and implementation of specific topics of interest. Currently the sections are divided into Algorithms, Coursera, Design Patterns, Project Euler, Projects and Unix. Algorithms are meant to hold my efficient implementation of algorithms either used in projects or learned from classes. Coursera holds the assignments and notes from classes taken on the website. Design Patterns hold example implementations of each pattern as well as common usages. Project Euler holds solutions to some of the problems on the site. Projects is where I place my prototype work or projects to enforce understanding on software concepts like websockets. Finally Unix is where I place things specific to Unix systems like Shell Commands and Linux Kernels. This repository allows me to grow my understanding of key Computer Science Concepts and helps me remember all the content that I learn. The repository for this project is located <a href="https://github.com/ryannewman2828/Documented-Learning" target="_blank">here</a></p>

    <p>The Student Pathways challenge was meant to help high school students gain a better understanding of available career oppurtunities and the pathways to get there by means of a digital tool. This was a 6 week competition where our team, The Communitechies, built a web application to help students find the perfect post-secondary educational institution and job to fit their personality. Our team placed 2<sup>nd</sup> overall from around 50 teams winning a cash prize of $13,000. I worked as the tech lead on this project meaning that in phase 1 of the competition I led the technical direction for the project in terms of algorithm designs, creation of the stories and programming of the entire backend. The backend consited of a RESTful api that managed the favouriting/generation of pathways and the algorithm was a simple configuration based approach to serve predetermined pathways. For phase 2, I developed a sustainable and scalable strategy for our app which included a dynamic pathway generation algorithm and recommender system to suggest personalized pathways. I presented our project with 2 others at the MaRS Discovery District infront of a panel of esteemed judges including the Chief Digital Officer of Ontario.</p> <p><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Andrew Chen, Tyler Zhang, Anirudh Kulkarni, Aqeel Kamadia, Daivak Goel</p>

    <p>Pl∀n is a web application that allows people to register accounts, login, add friends, send messages and plan meetings with friends. This application makes use of the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js) stack. Bootstrap and JQuery are used for easy styling and animations. Gulp is used as the file runner for compiling, concatinating and minifying files. SASS is used as the CSS framework for improved/abstracted styling. Mocha is used to unit test the functionality of the server while Protractor is used for the e2e testing of the site. Some cool features of this project include the application following The Twelve-Factor app methodology allowing it to be fully cloud native and using websockets for a realtime messaging/friend feature. This project is still a WIP with many features still to be added. These changes include implementing a more responsive/animated front end, deploying on a cloud based platform and implementing redis for session caching.

    <p>The main purpose of the UW Events App was to inform students about events that are often ignored. To accomplish this, we built a centralized hub where event information is located. Students can find information about event locations and receive email reminders to attend. All event information, employer sessions, workshops, entertainment and more, is available on the site. The site pulled information about these events from RSS' feeds from multiple sites then used php to dynamically display them on the page. We registered users and stored their information in a database and used mySQL to retrieve it then we sent reminder emails to the users using a python framework. The information was stored in an Amazon web services server. For the front-end of the site HMTL 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript was used to style the webpage, add animations/effects and dynamic scalability. Github was used as the version control and to allow everyone to contribute to the project. My personal responsibility for this project was being in charge of the front end. I found a starter template and did all of the styling, animating and scaling for the web application.

        <p>Cave Fighter is a Java based game programmed utilizing the JPanel and the JFrame. The game is based on Edmund McMillen’s and Florian Himsl’s, "The Binding of Isaac". The game uses a chunking algorithm to procedurally generate room layouts and fills them with random enemies in one of many predetermined patterns. This project was programmed as an educational exercise to demonstrate usage and understanding of object oriented programming principles such as abstraction for enemies, polymorphism for defining the specific behaviour for each of the subclasses and encapsulation for hiding information thus allowing usage of these classes only through a defined interface. The objective of the game is to fight through rooms until you reach the boss room. When the boss is defeated the game resets. This project has recently been refactored to include design patterns and make usage of popular Computer Science idioms such as the PIMPL idiom. The design patterns that were used include the singleton pattern for the main character and factory pattern for declaring the enemies. The repository for the game is located <a href="https://github.com/ryannewman2828/Cave-Fighter" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p>This was our project for Hack the 6ix 2017. The purpose of this application is to give home chefs a platform to market and sell their food. Its purpose is to also give people access to home cooked meals for cheaper when compared to take out. The application was programmed with use of the MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js stack. It allows for both consumer and vendor sign up while allowing you to specify your address and types of cuisine.

    <p>This was our project for Hack Western 2017. The purpose of this application was to provided depressed clients with a platform to connect with one another allowing them to see that they're not alone. To pair people together we first scraped the user's twitter account then used the Watson Sentiment Analysis API to develop a profile on the user and match people based on certain characteristics. After the pairing process is completed we monitor and send the user's chat history to the Watson's Tone Analysis API to gain insight into the user's mood and send the statistics to an administrative figure. For this project I programmed the backend using MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js and Firebase. The backend is interfacable through both a web and mobile client.

    <p>I personally designed this website from scratch. This website uses Jekyll to abstract out content and to combine configuration files written in YAML, template files written in Markdown and data files written in JSON into one coherent website. The Markdown files consist of HTML5 code and the styling is done in Sass which gets compiled down to CSS. Using the Bootstrap framework I was able to add dynamic scalability to the website meaning the website will automatically adapt to different sized browsers and devices. JavaScript along with jQuery were used to allow the skills in the skills tab to be loaded/unloaded on button pushes. A Golang script was also packaged with the site to allow for new entries, i.e. projects and skills, to be created with ease.</p>
